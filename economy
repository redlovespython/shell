2. **Economy Commands**
   - Implement basic economy commands like `balance`, `earn`, and `shop`.

   **Balance Command (`/commands/balance.js`)**:
   ```javascript
   const User = require('../models/User');

   module.exports = {
       name: 'balance',
       description: 'Check your current balance',
       async execute(message) {
           const user = await User.findOne({ userId: message.author.id }) || await User.create({ userId: message.author.id });
           message.channel.send(`${message.author.username}, you have ${user.balance} gold.`);
       },
   };
   ```

   **Earn Command (`/commands/earn.js`)**:
   ```javascript
   // Randomly awards currency to a user
   const User = require('../models/User');

   module.exports = {
       name: 'earn',
       description: 'Earn some gold',
       async execute(message) {
           const amount = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50) + 1; // Random amount between 1 and 50
           const user = await User.findOneAndUpdate({ userId: message.author.id }, { $inc: { balance: amount } }, { new: true, upsert: true });
           message.channel.send(`${message.author.username}, you earned ${amount} gold. Your new balance is ${user.balance} gold.`);
       },
   };
   ```

3. **Main Bot File (`index.js`)**
   - Initialize the bot, connect to the database, and set up command handling.

4. **Environment File (`.env`)**
   - Store your bot token and MongoDB URI.

### Running Your Bot
1. Set up MongoDB and obtain your connection string.
2. Fill in your `.env` file with `DISCORD_TOKEN` and `MONGODB_URI`.
3. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
4. Start your bot with `node index.js`.

### SOON
- Add more complex features like a shop system, trading between users, and earning gold through server activities.
- Implement admin commands for managing the economy, such as adjusting balances.
- Create events or games that users can participate in to earn currency.
